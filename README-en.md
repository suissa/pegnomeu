</p>

**Pegno** is a dependency manager with **global cache**, **auto-link**, **mini-workspaces** and **instant sync mode** — built 100% in **Bun + TypeScript**.

The idea was born because Bun promised "speed and simplicity" — but in practice, an essential layer is still missing:  
**real dependency reuse between projects**.

Each project reinstalls the same libs. Each build downloads again. Each dev wastes time.

**Pegno** solves this by creating a **global workspace** on your system, where dependencies are installed once and reused via *symlinks* (or copies, if you prefer).

---

## 🫠🤌🏻💗 Motivation: why did I create this for Bun?

Bun is fast.  
But fast **alone** is not enough.

npm and pnpm already understood that the future is **shared cache and package atomicity** — but Bun still depends on lockfiles and redundant reinstallation.

The **Pegno** philosophy is simple:

> **Code is ephemeral, cache is eternal.**

When you install `axios@latest` in one project, why download it again in another?  
**Pegno** creates a global repository (`~/.pegno_workspace/js`) and links packages directly to projects — like a dependency brain.

Additionally, it adds something no other manager offers:

### 🧠 Mini-workspaces (the "presets")

You can save dependency sets and apply them to any project:
```bash
pegno axios fastify zod
# Asks if you want to save as preset → type "api"

pegno use api
# installs everything again instantly
```

## ⚡️ Main features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|------------|
| 💾 **Intelligent Global Cache** | Each package is installed only once on the system. |
| 🪄 **Automatic Symlinks** | No `node_modules` duplication, everything points to global cache. |
| 📦 **Copy mode (`--copy`)** | If you want completely isolated builds. |
| 📚 **Mini-Workspaces** | Create named dependency sets and reapply in seconds. |
| 🧩 **Compatible with any Bun project** | Uses only native APIs (`fs`, `os`, `path`, `child_process`). |
| 🛠️ **`--dev` mode** | Adds packages directly to `devDependencies`. |
| 🧭 **`sync` mode** | Copies entire global workspace to local `node_modules`. |
| 🎨 **Colored logs (`kleur`)** | Levels, icons and installation times for quick debugging. |
| 🤗 **No external runtime dependencies** | Only `kleur` and Bun. 💯🚀🎯 |

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
bun add -g pegno

npm i -g pegno

# or running directly
npx pegno
```

Verify:
```bash
pegno --help
```

**⚠️ Windows:** If the command is not recognized, add Bun's global directory to PATH:
```powershell
# Add permanently to PATH (PowerShell as Admin)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";$env:USERPROFILE\.bun\bin", "User")
```

Expected output:
```
pegno CLI 1.3.0

Usage:
  pegno axios@latest   → Installs package directly
  pegno use api        → Uses saved miniworkspace
  pegno list           → Lists miniworkspaces
  pegno --dev          → Installs as devDependency
  pegno --copy         → Copies instead of linking
  pegno sync           → Copies entire global workspace
  pegno --verbose      → Detailed logs
```

---

## 💡 Usage example

```bash
# Installs axios globally and links to current project
pegno axios

# Installs multiple packages
pegno fastify zod openai

# Adds development packages
pegno --dev vitest typescript

# Creates and saves a mini-workspace
pegno use api
```

### 🪟 Windows Users

On Windows, it's recommended to use `--copy` mode due to permission restrictions for creating symlinks:

```bash
# Windows: use --copy to avoid permission errors
pegno --copy axios fastify zod

# Dev mode on Windows
pegno --dev --copy vitest typescript
```

**Why use `--copy` on Windows?**  
Windows requires special administrative privileges to create symlinks. The `--copy` mode physically copies packages to `node_modules`, ensuring full compatibility without needing to run as administrator.

## 📁 Internal structure

Pegno automatically creates:

```
~/.pegno/
├── js/
│   ├── axios__latest/
│   ├── fastify__5.0.0/
│   └── zod__3.23.0/
└── presets/
    ├── api.json
    ├── web.json
    └── utils.json
```

Each package is a complete directory (physical and reusable cache).
Presets are JSON descriptions with dependency lists.

---

## 🧠 Design philosophy

The project follows three principles:

1. **Zero redundancy** — Nothing is installed twice.
2. **Intelligent linking** — Each `node_modules` is a window to the global workspace.
3. **Brutalist simplicity** — Everything in TypeScript, no hidden magic.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- [ ] Hash-based registry (package checksum + version)
- [ ] Interactive CLI UI (`pegno ui`)

---

## 💬 Why "Pegno"?

Because **every tool needs a good provocation.**  
The idea is that it "grabs your module", but intelligently —  
making the global link of what should have been global from the beginning.

The name is an ironic homage to Brazilian hacker culture:  
provocative, good-humored and functional.
